# Geographically Provisioning IoT Devices on Azure

The goal of this repository is to articulate how you can implement IoT device geo-locking with Azure IoT Hub, Device Provisioning Service (DPS), Functions and Maps. Using these Azure services, you will learn how to control an IoT deviceâ€™s provisioning based on where they are connecting from.

The corresponding MS Tech Community blog that fully explains this architecture can be found <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/geographically-provisioning-iot-devices-on-azure/ba-p/3256823">here</a>.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A provisioned [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal)
2. A provisioned [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision#create-a-new-iot-hub-device-provisioning-service)
    - Ensure the IoT Hub from step 1 has been [linked](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision#link-the-iot-hub-and-your-device-provisioning-service) to this DPS
3. A provisioned [Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal#create-a-function-app)
    - Ensure the <b>Runtime Stack</b> and <b>Version</b> settings have been set to <b>.NET</b> and <b>6</b>
4. A provisioned [Azure Maps account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/how-to-manage-account-keys#create-a-new-account)
